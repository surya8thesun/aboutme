        <u><h1>Pandemic Haircut</h1></u>
        <p>
        It had been a long time.
         The coronavirus pandemic had spread rapidly
        and the lockdown had increased. But the
        lockdown was not the only thing that
        extended. My  hair had also extended
        exponentially. Since the odds of finding
        a barber were down to none, we
        had to deal with it ourselves
        , which we did, today.
        <br>
        Now you see, I had a specific routine
        , one I'd rather not skip. It is crucial.
        One thing out of balance and my day is done with and
        everything goes all over the place.
        <br>
          My schedule is pretty simple. I wake up at arond nine o'clock, brush my teeth, study just a little
          , bathe and then code for pretty much the whole day .I spend my whole summer like this. Now, when
          I spend an hour at something that is not in my routine, like a haircut, then I feel troubled for I could have done something 
          productive. 
        <br>
       
        Well with such a schedule, getting a haircut is a lot
        of trouble . Such trouble I felt today.
        <br>
        I woke up ( at 9:00 AM ) and immediately was
        taken to the hall.
        Just when things felt normal,
         my dad took up a scissor and 
        started cutting my hair, and I was
        not the happiest.
        <br>
        I don't have a problem with haircuts. 
        But with a schedule like mine,and the
        duration of a haircut, you are in the red
        zone.
        <br>
        Anyway, I was getting my haircut,and time
        was going fast. Anxiety was building up.
        Due to all this, I could not sit still, which is
        like most of the haircut.
        <br>
        Finally,at 10:05 ( too late ) , my dad was done and I was done with.
        Afraid of how I would look ( happens always )
        I looked into the mirror.
        <br>
        Surprise! What I saw was awesome! It looked 
        pretty decent. It was plain and good looking
        at the same time ( which is hard ).
        <br>
        It also so happened that after a little mending,
         I was able to get back on track with my 
        routine.
        <br>
        So, all-in-all, it was a pretty good day
         ( or morning ) .
