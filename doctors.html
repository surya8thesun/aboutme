      <h2><u>Doctors</u></h2>

      <h3>I felt heavy in the head</h3>
      <h3>and dry in the throat</h3>
      <h3>however I didn't dread</h3>
      <h3>I knew I had to see the white coat</h3>
      <br>
      <h3>Out I was in the clinic</h3>
      <h3>hoping not to be put to task.</h3>
      <h3>Out came a man like a hidden god</h3>
      <h3>hidden he was by a blue striped mask</h3>
      <br>
      <h3>His eyes were swollen</h3>
      <H3>his voice was trembling</H3>
      <h3>Yet he didn't stop</h3>
      <h3>for my life he was mending</h3>
      <br>
      <h3>As I left the clinic</h3>
      <h3>overwhelmed with gratitude</h3>
      <h3>Thank you all doctors and nurses</h3>
      <h3>We are inspired by your attitude</h3>
